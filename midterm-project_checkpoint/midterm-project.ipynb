    "**Deadline.** This project is due on **Wednesday, November 3rd, 11:59pm**. It's **much** better to be early than late, so start working now.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Checkpoint.** For full credit, **you must complete the checkpoint** (this is your first draft of the project). For the checkpoint, you must complete the questions up until the end of Part 2 (indicated by the cell that says \"End of Checkpoint\"), pass all public autograders, and **submit them by Wednesday, October 27, 11:59pm**. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Partners.** You may work with one other partner. Only one of you is required to submit the project in Gradescope.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rules.** Don't share your code with anybody but your partner. You are welcome to discuss questions with other students, but don't share the answers. The experience of solving the problems in this project will prepare you for exams (and life). If someone asks you for the answer, resist! Instead, you can demonstrate how you would solve a similar problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Support.** You are not alone! Come to office hours, post on Piazza, and talk to your classmates. If you want to ask about the details of your solution to a problem, make a private Piazza post and the staff will respond. If you're ever feeling overwhelmed or don't know how to make progress, send a Piazza message (public, private or anonymous) to your TA or tutor for help. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Tests.** Passing the tests for a question **does not** mean that you answered the question correctly. Tests usually only check that your table has the correct column labels. However, more tests will be applied to verify the correctness of your submission in order to assign your final score, so be careful and check your work!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advice.** Develop your answers incrementally. To perform a complicated table manipulation, break it up into steps, perform each step on a different line, give a new name to each result, and check that each intermediate result is what you expect. You can add any additional names or functions you want to the provided cells. \n",

    "In real-world studies, getting a truly representative random sample of the population is often incredibly difficult. Even just to accurately represent all Americans, a truly random sample would need to examine people across geographical, socioeconomic, community, and class lines (just to name a few). For a study like this, scientists would also need to make sure the medical exams were standardized and consistent across the different people being examined. In other words, there's a tradeoff between taking a more representative random sample and the cost of collecting more information from each person in the sample.\n",

    "The Framingham study collected high-quality medical data from its subjects, even if the subjects may not be a perfect representation of the population of all Americans. This is a common issue that data scientists face: while the available data aren't perfect, they're the best we have. The Framingham study is generally considered the best in its class, so we'll continue working with it while keeping its limitations in mind.\n",
